# UFO Sighting Data

## Purpose

The purpose of our table was to easily filter and display UFO sightings. To be able to explore and better understand the sightings we created several filters to filter the dataset.

## How to Filter

When opening the HTML doc, there are examples filled into the search bars. They match the format at which the table should be searched.

With the filters, you can filter by multiples items in the table. Depending on the selection, once you hit enter the table will filter and show you the results for that particular field.

You then also have the option to filter the table down further and drill down more into the data.

# Drawbacks and Recommendations

One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that it is not very organized. I think that having a landing page, then a seperate page with the table would make it easier to navigate and be more user friendly. 

A recommendation that I would make is to add an option to report their own sightings, and add to the table so there is more data available.

Another change I would make is to pull the data from an API key or somewhere more up to date as the data is pretty old and doesn't include more recent sightings.
